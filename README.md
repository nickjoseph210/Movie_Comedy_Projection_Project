# Movie_Comedy_Projection_Project

This is a personal web-scrape side project with the end-goal of determining the most profitable 'formula' for Hollywood comedies. 

As a comedy writer with several scripts under his belt, only one has seen production, and that was on a local stage in a city 1,000 miles away from me.  Not only that, but it was a comedy about single African-American women struggling to meet good, quality men online.  While I am not black woman, I was hired by one to write the project based on her outline.  She loved it and put it on stage, and - to her credit - she and the cast received several accolades for their work.  

But while comedy is still near and dear to my heart, writing scripts on spec as a freelance (okay, 'moonlighting') comedy writer pays less than an ideal wage, and I've got three kids to feed.

The purpose of this project is to see which Hollywood-produced comedies have been the most financially beneficial to their studios - a boring idea for any writer, for sure, but also a reminder that if a studio doesn't think it can make money off your idea, they're not likely to put the money into producing it.

My hope for this project is to give my fellow comedy writers insight to the patterns (if any) of comedies studios have produced so they can see how to maybe structure their projects in ways that would help them better their odds of getting produced and, thus, getting paid.
